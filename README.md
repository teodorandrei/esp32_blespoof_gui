Easy to use ESP32 BLE Spoofer with Tkinter GUI

# BLE Spoofing Script with ESP32 and Python GUI

This project is based on [ESP32-Sour-Apple by RapierXbox](https://github.com/RapierXbox/ESP32-Sour-Apple/tree/main) and allows you to perform **BLE spoofing** to simulate various Apple and non-Apple devices (such as AirPods, Apple TV, Samsung Galaxy Buds, and more) using an **ESP32** microcontroller. A simple **Python GUI** is provided to control which device you want to spoof and to start or stop the spoofing process.

## Features
- Spoof various BLE devices such as AirPods, Apple TV, Galaxy Buds, and more.
- Simple Python GUI to select devices and control spoofing.
- Built using the **ESP32-Sour-Apple** project by **RapierXbox**.
- Configurable to add more devices by extending the code.

## Requirements
- **ESP32** microcontroller (configured with BLE support).
- Python 3.x with the following libraries:
  - `tkinter` (for the GUI)
  - `pyserial` (for communication with ESP32)

## Installation

### 1. Install RapierXbox's [SourApple](https://github.com/RapierXbox/ESP32-Sour-Apple/tree/main)
2. Inside esp32_ble_spoof_gui.py, change the port variable to your desired serial port
3. Run the script using `python3 esp32_ble_spoof_gui.py`
